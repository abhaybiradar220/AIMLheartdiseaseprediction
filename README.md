# AIML Heart Disease Prediction 🫀

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics. Built to explore the intersection of AI and healthcare, with real-world applications in early diagnosis and risk assessment.

##Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. This project aims to build a predictive model using patient data to assist in early detection and intervention.

##Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves
- Drug recommendation logic based on prediction outcome

##Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

##Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhaybiradar220/AIMLheartdiseaseprediction.git
cd AIMLheartdiseaseprediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Run the notebook or script to:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Train and evaluate models

Predict heart disease risk for new data

Recommend appropriate drug interventions

📊 Results
Achieved over 85% accuracy with Random Forest. ROC curve shows strong classification performance.
