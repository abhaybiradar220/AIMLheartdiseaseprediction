Jan 2024 â€“ Mar 2024

Built and compared 3 ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Multiple Linear Regression) for predicting heart attack risk using the heart.csv dataset.

Preprocessed real-world medical data using feature scaling, missing value treatment, and train-test splitting.

Achieved model accuracy of:

SVM: 86% accuracy, 89% precision, 80% recall, 85% F1-score

Logistic Regression: 86% accuracy, 92% precision, 79% recall, 85% F1-score

Multiple Linear Regression: 85% accuracy, 93% precision, 76% recall, 83% F1-score

Used confusion matrix, ROC curves, and cross-validation for detailed performance evaluation.

Demonstrated that SVM performed best across all metrics, proving its suitability for binary health risk prediction.

Showcased the role of ML in early detection of cardiovascular issues to support timely medical intervention.
